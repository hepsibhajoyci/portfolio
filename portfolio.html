    <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
    <h3>Random password Generator</h3>
    <p>A Random Password Generator in Python is a program that creates secure and unpredictable passwords automatically using random combinations of characters. These characters typically include:

Uppercase letters (A–Z)

Lowercase letters (a–z)

Digits (0–9)

Special symbols (!, @, #, $, etc.)

The generator helps improve online security by avoiding predictable or reused passwords. Users can specify the desired length and optionally include/exclude character types based on their needs.

</p>
<h3> Hangman Game</h3>
<p>The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. It is a fun and educational way to practice logic, loops, and string manipulation in Python.

In the Python version of the game:

A random word is selected from a list.

The word is displayed as a series of underscores (_) representing each letter.

The player is prompted to guess a letter.

If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in the correct position(s).

If the guess is incorrect, a part of the hangman is drawn (or a counter decreases).

The game continues until:

The player guesses all letters correctly (wins), or

The player runs out of guesses (loses).</p>
